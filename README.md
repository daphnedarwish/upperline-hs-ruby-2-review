![ruby](http://media2.giphy.com/media/12jdalMQkt7iM/200.gif)

Time to review your Ruby skills! **Fork** (really important!) and clone this lab.

Follow the instructions and write your code in `ruby_review.rb`.

Then run `bundle install` in your terminal to install the Gems you need and `rspec` to run the tests to make sure your code is working properly.
